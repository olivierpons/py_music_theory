# py_music_theory
Python music theory simple generator. Simple but effective.

1. My son had to learn solfege, and he has a good memory
2. As soon as we had read once or twice the same notes, the day after he knew them by heart
3. When you learn solfege, you *shouldn't* know the order: you have to know the notes when you read them
4. The solution is to "mix" them
5. Hence this small Python program

First choose a picture to start from.
Don't worry theres already one ready here!
Then precise:

- where the background of the picture to generate is
- where all the small parts that should be shuffled are (= the notes)
- the name of the output.

To help you do this task, there's a "base" picture ready for it.
