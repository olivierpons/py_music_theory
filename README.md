# py_music_theory
Python music theory simple generator. Simple but effective.

1. If you/your son have to learn solfege
2. As soon as you/your son have read once or twice the same notes, the day after you might know them by heart
3. When you learn solfege, you have to know the notes when you read them: you *shouldn't* know the order: 
4. The solution is to shuffle them and to try to read them in a random order

...hence this small Python program

Everything is ready for you to try, but, thanks to Python, you can change everything according to your needs.
